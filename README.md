ðŸŽ² Hey! I'm Haruxe, welcome to my Github! ðŸŽ²

I am a proponent of open source content of all kinds, and contributing to other's projects which I love GitHub as a platform.

I believe the security of smart contracts in the blockchain should be top-notch because it sets the precident for other layers to build atop of it. Responsible disclosure is one of the most important things you can do at this time.

You can always find me at https://twitter.com/haruxeETH for updates,
and you can also message me on discord, which is Haruxe#5932.
