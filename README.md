ðŸŽ² Hey! I'm Haruxe, welcome to my Github! ðŸŽ²

I am a proponent of open source content of all kinds, and contributing to other's projects which I love GitHub as a platform.

Web3 is my main focus at the moment with websites focusing on the ethereum blockchain, but I also am a game developer with Unity and C#. You can find those games I have made on https://harux.itch.io/

You can always find me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/haruxeETH for updates,
and you can also message me on discord, which is Haruxe#5932.

My GitHub stats are below :) ðŸ‘‡
