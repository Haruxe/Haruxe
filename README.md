ðŸŽ² Hey! I'm haruxe, welcome to my Github! ðŸŽ²

I am a proponent of open source content of all kinds, and contributing to other's projects which I love GitHub as a platform.

I believe the security of smart contracts in the blockchain should be top-notch because it sets the precident for other layers to build atop of it. Responsible disclosure is one of the most important things you can do at this time.
